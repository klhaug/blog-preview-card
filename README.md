Built a blog preview card from the Frontend Mentor assignment. 

Got a refresher when it comes to viewport-borders, and also the calc() function so that we get responsive scaling of the card. 

Need to work a bit more on understanding the hierarchy of priorities when it comes to flexbox, and how the different elements affect eachother. I always figure it out, but I'd like to know it by heart. 

!UPDATE

Had to take a look at object-fit as well to make the image scaling responsive, keeping the same height but shrinking the width.
